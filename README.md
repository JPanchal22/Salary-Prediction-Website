# Salary-Prediction-Website

This "Salary Prediction Website" takes in the experience of a person as input and predicts his/her salary. Although it should be noted that this Linear Regression model was trained on a very small toy dataset which means the predictions would be far from accurate at times and also only the experience of a person is not enough to predict his/her salary. This was my very first Flask project and through this project, I wanted to learn how to deploy a ML model in Flask and create a website.
